*Low Level .Net Core Networking libraries benchmarked with UDP socket performance*

`![Screenshot](./Docs/screenshot.png)`

## Description

Benchmark for different low level .Net Core compatible libraries that are compatible with [Unity](https://unity3d.com), but also work as standalone console applications. The benchmark focuses on performance latency and scalability. The tests do not consider ease of use or supported features.

### Supported Libraries

* [ENet-CSharp](https://github.com/nxrighthere/ENet-CSharp) (v 2.4.3)
* [LiteNetLib](https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib) (v 0.9.3.2)
* [NetCoreServer](https://github.com/chronoxor/NetCoreServer) (v 3.0.20)

### Todo

- [ ] Test for maximum concurrent clients
- [ ] Test for Garbage generation
- [ ] Test for roundtrip time
- [ ] Generate statistics for benchmarks
